# favorite_food_list
A simple loop to print my favorite foods with love, my second tiny project.


## ðŸ“„ What does it do?

The script creates a list of foods and prints a message for each item in the list.

## ðŸ§  What I used

- Python
- Lists
- `for` loops
- `print()` function


## ðŸ“¦ Output

```
I love Pizza
I love French fries
I love Chicken nuggies
```

## ðŸš€ Why?

This project helps me get more comfortable working with loops and lists in Python. Itâ€™s fun to start small and build up.
